# Browser Engines GAnarchy
In the hopes of aiding experimentation around implementing:

* Simpler browser engines
* Declarative HTML/CSS extensions
* & radically new, and more accessible, browser UIs

I'm setting up this GAnarchy instance to track new browser engines and potential
components thereof. Maybe it'll even reduce the project management burden for
some of these projects.

Ideally these projects will show a more accessible, secure, private, and maintainable
path forward for the Web.

## Wanted
Please have try at implementing some CSS properties in Haskell. I don't care
how complete it is, but having something that way can help lead to an interesting
new browser engine. Which might be easier to hack around with.

If you like C or C++ NetSurf and Dillo already exist.
